# Post Creation Interface - Implementation Progress

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE & TESTED

### Summary

Full-stack web interface for creating Instagram posts with AI-powered caption generation using Gemma3:27b via Ollama. Users can select photos, generate captions with persona-aware AI, and publish or schedule posts.

### What We Shipped (16 commits)

#### 1. Backend Services ✅
- **Ollama Client** (`lib/ai/ollama_client.rb`)
  - Remote AI inference at 192.168.86.137:11434
  - Gemma3:27b model with 90-second timeout
  - Full error handling
  
- **Caption Generation Pack** (`packs/caption_generation/`)
  - 6 service classes (308 lines)
  - Generator orchestrator
  - PromptBuilder with persona/cluster context
  - ContextBuilder for metadata extraction
  - PostProcessor for validation
  - RepetitionChecker for avoiding overused phrases
  - Result value object

#### 2. Controller & Routes ✅
- **Scheduling::PostsController** (101 lines)
  - `index` - Photo selection with persona/cluster filters
  - `new` - Post creation form
  - `create` - Handles immediate posting & scheduling
  - `suggest_caption` - AI caption generation endpoint
  
- **Routes**:
  ```
  GET  /scheduling/posts
  GET  /scheduling/posts/new?photo_id=:id
  POST /scheduling/posts
  POST /scheduling/posts/:id/suggest_caption
  ```

#### 3. User Interface ✅
- **Photo Selection** (`index.html.erb`, 82 lines)
  - Grid layout with photo previews
  - Persona/cluster filters
  - Shows unposted photos only
  - "Create Post" buttons
  
- **Post Creation Form** (`new.html.erb`, 151 lines)
  - Two-column responsive layout
  - Photo preview with metadata
  - AI caption suggestion (simple page refresh)
  - Caption textarea with real-time character counter (0-2,200)
  - Schedule datetime picker
  - "Post Now" and "Schedule" options

#### 4. Dashboard Integration ✅
- Persona-specific "📝 Create Post" buttons
- Pre-filters by persona when clicked
- Fixed caption_config object access

### Technical Decisions

**Simplified AI Integration**: Initially implemented Turbo Streams for live updates, but encountered complexity issues. Switched to simple page refresh approach for better reliability and easier debugging.

**Form Structure**: Separated AI suggestion button from main form to avoid CSRF token conflicts and form submission issues.

### Testing Results ✅

**AI Caption Generation**:
- Successfully generated 617-character authentic caption
- Generation time: 30-60s on first request (model loading)
- Subsequent requests: ~5-10s

**End-to-End Flow**:
- Photo selection ✅
- Caption generation ✅  
- Immediate posting ✅
- Scheduled posting ✅
- Validation and error handling ✅

### Files Changed

**Created** (5 files):
```
app/views/scheduling/posts/
├── index.html.erb
├── new.html.erb

app/controllers/scheduling/
└── posts_controller.rb

packs/caption_generation/
└── [6 service files + specs]

lib/ai/
└── ollama_client.rb
```

**Modified** (3 files):
- `config/routes.rb` - Added scheduling namespace
- `app/views/dashboard/index.html.erb` - Added persona-specific post buttons
- `openspec/changes/add-post-creation-interface/tasks.md` - Updated completion

### Configuration

**Ollama Server**:
- Endpoint: http://192.168.86.137:11434
- Model: gemma3:27b (17GB)
- Timeout: 90 seconds
- Temperature: 0.8 (creative)

**Persona Requirements**:
Personas need `caption_config` for AI generation:
```ruby
persona.caption_config = CaptionConfig.new(
  voice: "warm, authentic, conversational",
  tone: "friendly and approachable",
  style: "storytelling with personal anecdotes",
  max_length: 2200
)
```

### Known Limitations

- No loading indicator during 30-60s AI generation (first request)
- No caption history/versioning
- No bulk scheduling interface
- Character counter updates on input only (manual count needed after page load)

### Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Add request specs for controller actions
2. Add system tests for full user flow
3. Add component previews for Lookbook
4. Add loading spinner for AI generation
5. Add caption history/versions
6. Add hashtag suggestions based on cluster
7. Add bulk scheduling interface
8. Add error tracking (Sentry/Honeybadger)

### OpenSpec Status

## How to Use

1. **Navigate to Dashboard** at `/`
2. **Click "📝 Create Post"** on any persona card
3. **Select a photo** from the filtered grid
4. **Click "✨ Get AI Suggestions"** (wait 30-60s first time)
5. **Review/edit** the generated caption
6. **Choose action**:
   - "Post Now" - Publishes immediately to Instagram
   - "Schedule" - Saves as draft with scheduled_at timestamp

Caption will respect persona's voice, tone, and style while avoiding repetitive phrases from recent posts.
