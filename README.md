Unified Persona-Based Content Creation and Instagram Scheduling Platform

## Overview

This application is a **unified content creation and social media management platform** that combines AI image generation, content strategy, and Instagram scheduling into a single workflow. It manages the entire content lifecycle from persona creation to automated posting:

### Core Capabilities

**🎭 Persona Management**
- Create and manage multiple social media personas
- Each persona has distinct content pillars (themes), caption configs, and hashtag strategies
- Visual dashboard showing content gaps and opportunities per persona

**📊 Content Strategy & Gap Analysis**
- Define content pillars (e.g., "Thanksgiving", "Fitness", "Travel") with weights and priorities
- Automated gap analysis identifies under-represented content areas
- Visual indicators show which pillars need more content (red = urgent, green = satisfied)
- Time-based pillar scheduling (start/end dates for seasonal content)

**🎨 AI Image Generation Pipeline**
- Multi-stage ComfyUI workflow execution (Base → Face Fix → Hand Fix → Upscale)
- Intelligent job selection using ELO-weighted prioritization
- Tree structure manages thousands of image candidates per run
- A/B voting interface for human curation and quality control
- Autonomous workers continuously generate and process images
- Per-run isolation: multiple pipelines can run simultaneously

**📸 Content Library**
- Organized photo library per persona
- Photos linked to content pillars for strategic organization
- Support for both uploaded photos and AI-generated images
- Gallery views with per-step filtering and approval gates

**📝 AI Caption & Hashtag Generation**
- Automated caption generation using Google Gemini API
- Context-aware captions based on persona voice and content pillar
- Smart hashtag suggestions with configurable strategies
- Manual editing and approval workflow

**📅 Instagram Scheduling & Posting**
- Schedule posts with automatic publishing via Instagram Graph API
- Visual calendar interface showing upcoming posts
- Draft management with caption and image preview
- Automated hourly posting via cron jobs
- Status tracking: draft → scheduled → posted/failed

**⚙️ Workflow Automation**
- Background workers (Sidekiq) for autonomous image generation
- Automated content suggestion based on gap analysis
- One-click content creation: gap → AI prompt → generation → voting → approval → scheduling
- Integration with ComfyUI for GPU-accelerated image generation


## What Can This Application Do?

This platform enables end-to-end content creation and social media management:

### Complete Workflow Example

1. **Create a Persona** → Define "Sarah - Fitness Influencer"
2. **Set Content Strategy** → Add pillars: "Gym Workouts" (30%), "Meal Prep" (25%), "Motivation" (25%), "Lifestyle" (20%)
3. **Run Gap Analysis** → System identifies "Gym Workouts" needs 5 more photos
4. **Generate AI Content** → Click "Generate Content" → AI creates prompt → ComfyUI generates images
5. **Vote & Curate** → A/B voting selects best images → Approve final candidates
6. **Create Post** → Select image → AI generates caption → Add hashtags → Schedule for 7 PM
7. **Automated Posting** → Cron job publishes to Instagram at scheduled time

### Quick Start: Content Creation Workflow

Complete workflow from gap analysis to Instagram posting:

```bash
# 1. Create a persona
open http://localhost:3000/personas/new

# 2. Add content pillars (e.g., "Fitness", "Travel", "Food")
# Visit persona page and click "New Pillar"

# 3. Run gap analysis to identify content needs
# Gaps automatically displayed on persona dashboard

# 4. Generate content for a gap
# Click "Generate Content" on a pillar with low content

# 5. Vote on generated images
open http://localhost:3000/runs/:id/vote

# 6. Approve final images
open http://localhost:3000/runs/:id/gallery

# 7. Schedule Instagram post
open http://localhost:3000/personas/:id/scheduling/posts/new

# 8. AI generates caption automatically
# Edit caption and schedule for posting
```

### Quick Start: Running Pipelines

```bash
# 1. Create an example pipeline with 4 steps
bin/rails pipeline:setup_example

# 2. Update ComfyUI workflow JSON for your actual workflows
#    (Edit in Rails console or database)

# 3. Start autonomous workers
bundle exec sidekiq

# 4. Create more runs as needed
bin/rails pipeline:create_run[3,"Beach Shoot","person on the beach, sunset"]
```

See `docs/PIPELINE_SETUP.md` for complete setup guide.

### Running Autonomous Workers

To run the system autonomously:

```bash
# Start the Sidekiq workers
bundle exec sidekiq

# This starts both workers:
# - JobSubmitterWorker: Selects and submits jobs every 10s
# - JobPollerWorker: Polls and processes jobs every 5s
```

Configure via environment variables:

```bash
# ComfyUI connection
COMFYUI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8188  # API endpoint
COMFYUI_TIMEOUT=300                      # Request timeout (seconds)
COMFYUI_MAX_RETRIES=3                    # Retry attempts

# Worker intervals
COMFYUI_SUBMIT_INTERVAL=10  # Seconds between job submissions
COMFYUI_POLL_INTERVAL=5     # Seconds between status polls

# Job selection algorithm
MAX_CHILDREN_PER_NODE=2  # Max children per candidate (breadth-first: 2-3 recommended)
TARGET_LEAF_NODES=10     # Target final candidates

bundle exec sidekiq
```

### Instagram Scheduling Setup

To enable automated Instagram posting:

1. **Configure Instagram Credentials**

Add your Instagram Business Account credentials to Rails encrypted credentials:

```bash
bin/rails credentials:edit
```

```yaml
instagram:
  app_id: "your_facebook_app_id"
  app_secret: "your_facebook_app_secret"
  access_token: "your_long_lived_user_access_token"
  account_id: "your_instagram_business_account_id"

gemini:
  api_key: "your_gemini_api_key"  # For AI caption generation
```

2. **Set Up Cron Job for Automated Posting**

Add to your crontab (runs every hour):

```bash
crontab -e
```

```
0 * * * * cd /path/to/turbo-carnival && bin/scheduled_posting.sh
```

3. **Test Manual Posting**

```bash
# Schedule a post immediately
bin/rails scheduling:post_scheduled

# Or via web interface
open http://localhost:3000/personas/:id/scheduling/posts/new
```

See `docs/instagram-scheduling.md` for detailed setup instructions.

**Job Selection Strategy**:
The system uses a **per-parent breadth-first** approach with **round-robin run selection**:

**Per-Run Round-Robin**:
- Multiple PipelineRuns can be active simultaneously
- System cycles through runs fairly: Run A → Run B → Run C → Run A...
- Each run progresses independently
- Completed runs are excluded from job selection

**Per-Parent Breadth-First**:
- Each parent candidate gets N children (default: 2) before moving to next step
- Ensures full tree exploration - no "bottom-right" branch starvation
- Tree grows geometrically: 2 → 4 → 8 → 16 → 32 candidates per step
- Control growth by rejecting low-ELO candidates early

**Example Tree Growth (N=2)**:
```
Step 1: [Parent A, Parent B]           = 2 total
Step 2: [2 from A, 2 from B]           = 4 total  
Step 3: [2 from each of 4 parents]     = 8 total
Step 4: [2 from each of 8 parents]     = 16 total
```

**Configuration**:
- `MAX_CHILDREN_PER_NODE=2` - Children per parent (keep at 2-3 for manageable growth)
- `TARGET_LEAF_NODES=10` - Maintain this many candidates in final step (deprecated in favor of per-parent strategy)


## How It Works

### Core Data Models

**Persona** - Social media identity/character
- Has many content pillars (content themes)
- Has many photos (content library)
- Stores caption_config (JSONB) for AI caption generation settings
- Stores hashtag_strategy (JSONB) for hashtag selection preferences

**ContentPillar** - Content theme/category (e.g., "Fitness", "Travel")
- Belongs to a persona
- Has weight (0-100) for content distribution targets
- Has priority (1-5) for scheduling preference
- Optional date range for seasonal content
- Has many photos

**ContentPillars::Photo** - Individual photo in content library
- Belongs to a content pillar
- ActiveStorage attachment for image file
- Can be uploaded or AI-generated

**Scheduling::Post** - Instagram post
- Belongs to persona
- References a photo
- Stores caption, hashtags, scheduled_at timestamp
- State machine: draft → scheduled → posted/failed
- Tracks provider_post_id from Instagram API

**Pipeline** - Reusable AI generation pipeline template
- Has many ordered pipeline steps
- Has many pipeline runs
- Can be linked to persona

**PipelineStep** - Stage in generation pipeline
- Stores ComfyUI workflow JSON with `{{template_variables}}`
- Boolean flags for variable requirements
- Per-step N value for generation control

**PipelineRun** - Single execution of a pipeline
- Stores run-specific variables in JSONB
- Has target_folder for organizing output images
- Status tracking: pending → running → completed/failed
- Creates many ImageCandidates

**ImageCandidate** - Single AI-generated image
- Belongs to pipeline step and pipeline run
- Self-referential tree structure (parent/children)
- ELO score (default 1000) updated via A/B voting
- State machine: active → rejected, with winner flag
- Image path stored for use by subsequent steps


### Variable System & Template Substitution

The variable system allows you to parameterize ComfyUI workflows and reuse pipeline definitions with different inputs.

#### How It Works

1. **Define template variables** in your ComfyUI workflow JSON using `{{variable_name}}` syntax
2. **Declare requirements** on each PipelineStep using boolean flags
3. **Provide values** when creating a PipelineRun via the `variables` JSONB field
4. **Template substitution** happens automatically when building job payloads

#### Template Variable Syntax

In your ComfyUI workflow JSON, use double curly braces for variables:

```json
{
  "107": {
    "inputs": {
      "seed": {{seed}}
    },
    "class_type": "Seed"
  },
  "121": {
    "inputs": {
      "text": "{{prompt}}"
    },
    "class_type": "Text Multiline"
  },
  "122": {
    "inputs": {
      "filename_prefix": "sarah1a3/{{run_name}}_base_image_",
      "images": ["77", 0]
    },
    "class_type": "SaveImage"
  }
}
```

**Important**: 
- Numeric values: `"seed": {{seed}}` (no quotes around template)
- String values: `"text": "{{prompt}}"` (quotes around entire string)
- The system does simple string replacement, so format accordingly

#### PipelineStep Variable Requirement Flags

Each PipelineStep declares what data it needs using boolean flags:

**`needs_run_prompt`** (deprecated - use `needs_run_variables` instead)
- Legacy flag: Makes `prompt` from PipelineRun variables available
- Use `needs_run_variables` for new implementations

**`needs_parent_image_path`**
- Automatically provides `{{parent_image_path}}` template variable
- Value comes from the parent ImageCandidate's `image_path` field
- Used for steps that process existing images (face fix, upscale, etc.)
- Example: `"image": "{{parent_image_path}}"`

**`needs_run_variables`**
- Provides ALL variables from the PipelineRun's `variables` JSONB field
- Most flexible option - use for any custom variables
- Variables become available as template substitutions
- Example variables: `prompt`, `seed`, `run_name`, `persona_id`, `style`, etc.

#### Variable Substitution Process

When `BuildJobPayload` constructs a job for ComfyUI:

```ruby
# 1. Load workflow JSON template from PipelineStep
workflow_json = pipeline_step.comfy_workflow_json

# 2. Replace all {{variable}} placeholders with actual values
pipeline_run.variables.each do |key, value|
  workflow_json.gsub!("{{#{key}}}", value.to_s)
end

# 3. If needs_parent_image_path, add parent's path
if pipeline_step.needs_parent_image_path
  workflow_json.gsub!("{{parent_image_path}}", parent_candidate.image_path)
end

# 4. Parse as JSON and submit to ComfyUI
workflow = JSON.parse(workflow_json)
```

#### Example: Complete Pipeline Setup

```ruby
# Create pipeline template (define once)
pipeline = Pipeline.create!(name: "Portrait Generation")

# Step 1: Base image generation
step1 = pipeline.pipeline_steps.create!(
  name: "Base Image",
  order: 1,
  comfy_workflow_json: File.read("workflows/base_image.json"),
  needs_run_variables: true  # Needs: seed, prompt, run_name
)

# Step 2: Face refinement
step2 = pipeline.pipeline_steps.create!(
  name: "Face Fix",
  order: 2,
  comfy_workflow_json: File.read("workflows/face_fix.json"),
  needs_run_variables: true,      # Needs: seed, run_name
  needs_parent_image_path: true   # Needs: parent image
)

# Step 3: Final upscale
step3 = pipeline.pipeline_steps.create!(
  name: "Upscale",
  order: 3,
  comfy_workflow_json: File.read("workflows/upscale.json"),
  needs_run_variables: true,      # Needs: seed, prompt, run_name
  needs_parent_image_path: true   # Needs: parent image
)

# Execute multiple times per day with different variables
run1 = pipeline.pipeline_runs.create!(
  name: "Morning Gym Session",
  target_folder: "runs/2025-11-10/gym",
  variables: {
    seed: 1000001,
    prompt: "person at the gym, athletic wear, exercising",
    run_name: "gym_session",
    persona_id: 123,
    style: "photorealistic"
  }
)

run2 = pipeline.pipeline_runs.create!(
  name: "Afternoon Coffee Shop",
  target_folder: "runs/2025-11-10/cafe",
  variables: {
    seed: 1000002,
    prompt: "person at coffee shop, casual clothes, reading book",
    run_name: "cafe_session",
    persona_id: 123,
    style: "photorealistic"
  }
)
```

#### ComfyUI Output Requirements

**Critical**: Your workflow MUST include a SaveImage node (or similar output node) or ComfyUI will reject it with "Prompt has no outputs".

```json
{
  "122": {
    "inputs": {
      "filename_prefix": "{{run_name}}_step1_",
      "images": ["77", 0]
    },
    "class_type": "SaveImage"
  }
}
```

**Output file structure**:
- ComfyUI saves to its `output/` directory
- Filename: `{filename_prefix}{number}_.png`
- Example: `gym_session_step1_00001_.png`
- The system retrieves this path via ComfyUI's history API
- Path is stored in ImageCandidate's `image_path` field for use by child steps

#### Common Variable Patterns

**Required for most workflows**:
- `seed` - Random seed for reproducibility (numeric, no quotes in template)
- `prompt` - Text description of desired image
- `run_name` - Identifier for organizing outputs

**Optional but recommended**:
- `persona_id` - Reference to character/subject being generated
- `style` - Art style descriptor ("photorealistic", "anime", etc.)
- `negative_prompt` - Things to avoid in generation
- `cfg_scale` - Classifier-free guidance strength
- `steps` - Number of diffusion steps

**Step-specific**:
- `parent_image_path` - Automatically provided when `needs_parent_image_path: true`
- Any custom parameters your ComfyUI workflow requires


## Examples

### Example Usage

#### Quick Start with Rake Task

```bash
# Create complete 4-step portrait pipeline with sample run
bin/rails pipeline:setup_example

# Create additional runs
bin/rails pipeline:create_run[3,"Cafe Shoot","person at coffee shop, reading"]
bin/rails pipeline:create_run[3,"Park Shoot","person in park, walking dog"]

# Start autonomous workers
bundle exec sidekiq
```

For detailed setup instructions, see `docs/PIPELINE_SETUP.md`.

#### Pipeline Setup (Manual)

```ruby
# Define pipeline template once
pipeline = Pipeline.create!(name: "Portrait Generation")

# Step 1: Base image - needs prompt, seed, run_name from variables
step1 = pipeline.pipeline_steps.create!(
  name: "Base Image", 
  order: 1,
  comfy_workflow_json: '{
    "seed_node": {"inputs": {"seed": {{seed}}}},
    "prompt_node": {"inputs": {"text": "{{prompt}}"}},
    "save_node": {"inputs": {"filename_prefix": "{{run_name}}_base_"}}
  }',
  needs_run_variables: true  # Provides: seed, prompt, run_name, and all other variables
)

# Step 2: Face fix - needs parent image and seed/run_name
step2 = pipeline.pipeline_steps.create!(
  name: "Face Fix",
  order: 2,
  comfy_workflow_json: '{
    "load_node": {"inputs": {"image": "{{parent_image_path}}"}},
    "seed_node": {"inputs": {"seed": {{seed}}}},
    "save_node": {"inputs": {"filename_prefix": "{{run_name}}_face_"}}
  }',
  needs_run_variables: true,      # Provides: seed, run_name
  needs_parent_image_path: true   # Provides: parent_image_path
)

# Step 3: Upscale - needs both prompt and parent image
step3 = pipeline.pipeline_steps.create!(
  name: "Upscale",
  order: 3,
  comfy_workflow_json: '{
    "load_node": {"inputs": {"image": "{{parent_image_path}}"}},
    "prompt_node": {"inputs": {"text": "{{prompt}}"}},
    "save_node": {"inputs": {"filename_prefix": "{{run_name}}_upscale_"}}
  }',
  needs_run_variables: true,      # Provides: prompt, seed, run_name
  needs_parent_image_path: true   # Provides: parent_image_path
)
```

#### Execute Pipeline Runs

```ruby
# Run multiple times per day with different variables
gym_run = pipeline.pipeline_runs.create!(
  name: "Gym Shoot",
  target_folder: "/storage/runs/2025-11-09/gym-shoot",
  variables: {
    seed: 1000001,
    prompt: "person at the gym, athletic wear",
    run_name: "gym_shoot",
    persona_id: 123
  }
)

home_run = pipeline.pipeline_runs.create!(
  name: "Home Shoot",
  target_folder: "/storage/runs/2025-11-09/home-shoot",
  variables: {
    seed: 1000002,
    prompt: "person at home, casual clothes",
    run_name: "home_shoot",
    persona_id: 123
  }
)

# Each run's variables are substituted into step workflows
# All generated images organized in the run's target_folder
# gym_shoot_base_00001_.png, gym_shoot_face_00001_.png, etc.
```

#### Select Next Job

```ruby
# The system intelligently decides which job to run next
result = SelectNextJob.call

case result.mode
when :child_generation
  # Generate child from selected parent candidate
  parent = result.parent_candidate
  next_step = result.next_step
  
  # Submit job to ComfyUI (workers do this automatically)
  SubmitJob.call(
    pipeline_step: next_step,
    pipeline_run: parent.pipeline_run,
    parent_candidate: parent
  )

when :base_generation
  # No eligible parents, but need more final candidates
  # Generate new base image
  step = result.next_step  # First step
  
  SubmitJob.call(
    pipeline_step: step,
    pipeline_run: PipelineRun.last  # Or create new run
  )

when :no_work
  # Pipeline is complete or no deficit
  # System is satisfied
end
```


### Monitoring

```ruby
# In Rails console

# Check pipeline status
pipeline = Pipeline.find(1)
pipeline.pipeline_runs.each do |run|
  puts "#{run.name}: #{run.image_candidates.count} images"
end

# View job queue
ComfyuiJob.in_flight.count   # Currently processing
ComfyuiJob.pending.count     # Waiting to submit
ComfyuiJob.completed.count   # Finished

# See what's next
result = SelectNextJob.call
puts "Next: #{result.mode} - #{result.next_step&.name}"
```


### Next Steps

The system is fully functional! Future enhancements:

- 🎨 Web UI for viewing ImageCandidates
- 🗳️ A/B voting interface for ELO score updates
- 📊 Dashboard showing pipeline progress and statistics

## Development

### Pre-commit Validation

Run the full validation suite before committing:

```bash
bin/rspec --fail-fast && bin/packwerk check && bin/packwerk validate && bundle exec rubocop --fail-fast
```


## Development Conventions

See `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` for full details:

- **No controller specs** - Use request specs for HTTP testing
- **GLCommand pattern** - Isolate business logic with rollback support
- **Isolated unit tests** - Mock external dependencies
- **State machines** - Use `state_machines-activerecord` for status fields
- **ViewComponents** - All UI components with preview files
- **Packwerk** - Enforce domain boundaries
- **Safe migrations** - Schema-only migrations, separate data tasks
