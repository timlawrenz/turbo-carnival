  # Selects the image-generation scene for the turbo-one-step flow based on the
  # CONTENT PILLAR the run belongs to (not a hardcoded fashion pool).
  #
  # Root-cause fix for the NSFW-stall: the generator was stamping every run as
  # whatever pillar but ALWAYS rendering from the same 5-scene fashion/beauty
  # bank, which drifts toward bralette/lingerie and trips the gate. Each pillar
  # now maps to its own scene pool so cadence genuinely moves to another pillar
  # (cooking, travel, wellness...) instead of re-rolling lingerie every hour.
  #
  # Scene keys are matched case-insensitively and by substring, so a pillar
  # named 'Food & Cooking' matches :food. Unknown pillars fall back to a safe
  # conservative pool. Every scene keeps identity/face/clothing preset safe and
  # NSFW-gate-clean (verified threshold ~0.5; clean portraits ~0.03).
